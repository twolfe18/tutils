### maven deploy + gpg plugin
# Make sure pom.xml doesn't isn't a SNAPSHOT version, do whatever git
# tagging/committing you're going to do, and then:
mvn deploy -Prelease





### maven-release-plugin way of doing things
# NOTE: I had problems with this: it kept trying to release SNAPSHOT versions
# even though I was telling it to do a full release.

mvn release:prepare
mvn -Darguments=-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Prelease release:perform

# You can go backwards with
mvn release:clean
# but this will not un-do everything it did, e.g. change from SNAPSHOT to non-SNAPSHOT in your pom.xml file

# If you screw up and need to un-do the tags
git tag -d tutils-1.0.0                   # local
git push origin :refs/tags/tutils-1.0.0   # remote
